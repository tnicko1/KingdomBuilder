# Kingdom Builder

This game was one of my assignments for Data Structures class. we weren't supposed to build a gui but I got too invested and went all out. keep in mind that this is not a full fledged game but rather a fun project I spent maybe about a week building and decided to share it for fun.



## Installation

I'm releasing the zip file containing all the assets, dlls and most importantly the executable file. so just download that from releases section and run the executable. I'm just a beginner dunno how this stuff works yet lmao

windows defender might warn you for possible threats. I don't have money to sign the program 😭 just press "more info > run anyway" there is no malware, source: trust me bro!


if you're having errors trying to run the program, you must install Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 before playing. if you don't have it:
   Download link: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

if for some reason that still doesn't work just clone the repository and build the project yourself. doubt that worth the effort for this game though :)
## Lessons Learned

I learned a good amount of C++ SFML libraries while building this project. also how to release stuff on GitHub, how to write README markdowns (which you're currently reading), how to work with CMake files (pain)

Most importantly I learned that all of this doesn't matter, some random dude on StackOverflow already built what I did 20 years ago, so I'm 2 decades late to the party and I didn't even get maximum grades for this project ( we were supposed to build console application, built whole gui and everything extra they didn't ask for and got 89/100. such is the life 😮‍💨)

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a programming enthusiast. I write dumb projects like this one and share them on github. I also review movies, anime and video games for fun. check them out ( please 😭)
